# Medicine Dispenser

Stefan, Andrew, Jeff


## Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a Medicine Dispenser based on the STM32 microcontroller. The project aims to provide a convenient and automated solution for dispensing medicines at scheduled times.

## Features

- **Automated Dispensing:** The system is designed to automatically dispense medicines at specified intervals.
- **User Interface:** A user-friendly interface allows users to set dispensing schedules and monitor the status of the dispenser.
- **STM32 Microcontroller:** The project utilizes the power and flexibility of the STM32 microcontroller for precise control and reliability.

## Hardware Requirements

- STM32 Microcontroller (e.g., STM32F4 Discovery)
- Motor Driver
- Pumo
- Keypad/Button Interface

## Software Requirements

- STM32CubeIDE
- CMSIS and HAL Libraries
- [Additional libraries or dependencies]

## Getting Started
